- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheMathematico
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python.

  What you may do with my code:
  You may modify my code.
  You may use my code.

  What you may NOT do with my code:
  You may NOT publish my code WITHOUT giving me credits.
  You may NOT claim my code as yours.

  My code isn't that advanced, it's mostly simple math programs
  aswell as a bit of other stuff!

  You can find all of my programs and code in different branches.
  You're currently in the main branch, i recommend checking out my mathprogram branch!
  
  I hope my code helps you as much as it can.
