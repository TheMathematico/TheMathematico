- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @TheMathematico
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programming!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python.

  What you may do with my code:
  You may modify my code.
  You may use my code.

  What you may NOT do with my code:
  You may NOT publish my code WITHOUT giving me credits.
  You may NOT claim my code as yours.

  how to use:
  Same for the input version, the code asks for num1, num2, and symbol(+,-,*,/) and then it shows the result in the label.
  The entry at the first line is num1, the entry at the second line is the symbol and the entry at the third line is num2.

  I hope my code helps you as much as it can.
